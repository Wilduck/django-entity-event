Quickstart and Basic Usage
==========================

Django Entity Event is a great way to collect events that your users
care about into a unified location. The parts of your code base that
create these events are probably totally separate from the parts that
display them, which are also separate from the parts that manage
subscriptions to notifications. Django Entity Event makes separating
these concers as simple as possible, and provides convenient
abstractions at each of these levels.

This quickstart guide handles the three parts of managing events and
notifications.

1. Creating, categorizing, and storing events.
2. Displaying events to users in different ways.
3. Managing which events go where, and who are subscribed to them.
